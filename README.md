# Sign-In Code Challenge: Android Project with Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, and Reqres.in API Simulation 🚀

Welcome to the Sign-In Code Challenge repository! This project showcases a robust sign-in feature developed for Android applications using the power of Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. With a focus on modern technologies and best practices, we've implemented a modular architecture and utilized Dagger Hilt for efficient dependency injection, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and testability of the codebase. 💻

**Technologies Used:**

- **Kotlin 😎:** The entire project is crafted in Kotlin, offering concise, expressive, and readable codebase. 
  
- **Jetpack Compose 🎨:** The user interface is built using Jetpack Compose, a modern Android UI toolkit known for its declarative syntax and interactive UI components. 

- **Modular Architecture:** We've organized the project into well-defined modules, enhancing code reusability and making collaboration among developers more effective. 

- **Dependency Injection:** Dagger Hilt is implemented for dependency injection, ensuring loose coupling between components, making the codebase more modular and testable.

**API Simulation 🌐:**

To simulate REST API services , we are utilizing **Reqres.in**, a service that mimics various API endpoints like sign-in, list-users, and register. This enables realistic testing and demonstration of API interactions within the Android application. 

**Key Features:**

1. **Sign-In Functionality 🔐:** Users can securely sign in to the application using their credentials, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience. 

2. **Modularity:** The project is structured into modules, allowing for independent development and testing of specific features. 

3. **Dependency Injection:** Dagger Hilt simplifies dependency management, making the application's components more manageable and testable. 

4. **Jetpack Compose UI:** The user interface is developed using Jetpack Compose, ensuring an engaging and responsive experience for users.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/SteveCampos/SignInChallenge`.

2. Open the project in Android Studio or your preferred IDE.

3. Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute to the project, or utilize it as a reference for your own Android applications. We welcome feedback, bug reports, and feature requests from the community to enhance this project further. Happy coding! 🚀😊
